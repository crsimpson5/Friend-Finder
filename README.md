# Friend-Finder

Friend finder is a Node application that uses Express routing to load pages and recieve data. Friend finder will give the user a 10 question survey. Each field must be completed before submitting. 

When the form is submitted, the data is sent with a POST request. The answers are compared to each person to find who has the closest values overall. The page will then display the best match.
